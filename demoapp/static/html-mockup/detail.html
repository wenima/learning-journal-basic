                    <p>Learned about the Deque datastructure which seemed pretty clear once visualized.
                    Today's big topic was Pyramid and it was difficult to follow along while keeping up typing along to build
                    a starter project. There are different kinds of scaffolds, we used the starter on. Everthing in Pyramid is packaged, Pyramid itself is a package and you can plug ins
                    any renderer you wish. We removed the default one and will be using Jinja2 which I heard about but have not used yet.
                    Pyramid seperates the models, view from Controller from client facing views. This means that when a request comes in, a route is looked up matching a certain views. href="
                    That view then uses a callable which generates a Response.</p>
